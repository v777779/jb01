      Exercises code for Book of Bruce Eckel "Thinking in Java" 
      
      Project is done for IntelliJ IDEA
      
      Many chapter folders deactivated by labeling as "Excluded" from the sources 
      This done because of too large number of files 
      
      To activate any chapter  
      Project Window >> Select Folder >> Right Mouse Button >>  Make Directory as >> Cancel Exclusion 
      To deactivate any chapter folder do the same way but >> Excluded
       
      Sorry guys, but all comments in Russian.
