      Exercises code for Book of Bruce Eckel "Thinking in Java" 
      With the small exception all exercises are the original solution.
      Not all of the solutions are the right the book required.
      
      Project is done for IntelliJ IDEA
      Most folders marked as "Excluded", because of too large number of files
      The IDEA very slow indexes large amount of files.
      But all chapters and exercises are independent to others, so it's possible
      to activate/deactivate any chapter at any time.
      As I noted more than 20 exercises slows IDEA and it can hangs.
      
      To activate any chapter  folder
      Project Window >> Select Folder >> Right Mouse Button >>  Make Directory as >> Cancel Exclusion 
      To deactivate any chapter folder do the same way but >> Excluded
       
      Sorry guys, but all comments in Russian.
