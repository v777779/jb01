      Exercises code for Book of Bruce Eckel "Thinking in Java" <BR>
      Project is done for IntelliJ IDEA <BR>
      Many chapter folders deactivated by labeling as "Excluded" from the sources <BR>
      This done because of too large number of files <BR>
      To activate any chapter  <BR>
      Project Window >> Select Folder >> Right Mouse Button >>  Make Directory as >> Cancel Exclusion <BR>
      To deactivate any chapter folder do the same way but >> Excluded <BR><BR>
       
      Sorry guys, but all comments in Russian. <BR>
