      Exercises code for Book of Bruce Eckel "Thinking in Java" 
      With the small exception all exercises are the original solution.
      Not all of the solutions were done  as required in the book.
            
      Last exercise  is chapter 22 exercise 37.
      
      Exercises 38..43 of chapter 22 were skipped because of they are connected 
      with obsoleted Flash and SWT.
           
      Sorry guys, but all comments in Russian.
